<p>Hello! My name is Nida and i am from BSCS 6B. I am a transfer from section B.</p>
<p>I have never worked with html before but i have basic knowledge about it. I am a fast learner and a hardworker so i will cover all the material from class within a week Inshallah!</p>
<p>So far this class seems interesting and i cant wait to learn all that this class has to offer.
Below is the image that i could think of attaching:</p>
